Fixed point square root function
--------------------------------

Computing the square root of an integer or a fixed point into a fixed point integer. A fixed point is a 32 bit value with the comma between the bits 15 and 16, where bit 0 is the least significant bit of the value. 
  
The algorithms can be easily extended to 64bit integers, or different fixed point comma positions.
